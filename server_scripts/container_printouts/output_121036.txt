INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of torchrl to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install torch==2.2.2 and torchrl==0.5.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==2.2.2
    torchrl 0.5.0 depends on torch>=2.3.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
