# Human Learning and Decision-Making Models

RouteRL provides a catalog of human learning and decision-making models, including three discrete choice models. These models, popular within transportation community, emulate human agents as utility maximizers, where individual utilities are influenced by individual characteristicsâ€”unlike reinforcement learning algorithms that primarily focus on cost minimization.

    Users can create their own human models by inheriting ``BaseLearningModel``.
