# Implementation of Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms on RouteRL framework

---

In these notebooks, we utilize the Csömör network in our simulator [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/), where agents-vehicles will determine their route choices.

## Number and type of agents

The number and type of agents in our experiments can be adjusted as needed. Agent information is provided in the `training_records/agents.csv` file.
