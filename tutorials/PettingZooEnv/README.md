# Introduction to our multi-agent PettingZoo framework and its functionalities

In these notebooks, we use a two-route network in our simulator [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/), where agents (vehicles) navigate from their predefined origin to their predefined destination point, aiming to determine the fastest route.

## Number and type of agents

The number and type of agents in our experiments can be adjusted as needed. Agent information is provided in the `RouteRL/network_and_config/agents_data.csv` file.
